# VDOOM
This project is built on the [source code of DOOM](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM), and intends to rewrite that original source code to C++, while also adding other convenient features along the way.

English only currently.

Uses CMAKE Standard 17.

## Plans
- Rewrite the rest of the code
- Write a make file for building
- Test from there
